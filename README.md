# IoT-based-Dust-Detection-and-Management-system
Environmental pollution has emerged as a critical global issue in recent times, particularly 
with regard to air quality in urban regions. Of the various pollutants, particulate matter (PM) 
stands out as a significant contributor to air pollution, posing substantial health risks to 
individuals. Monitoring PM levels has thus become imperative to uphold air quality 
standards. This project introduces an innovative solution—a dust detection system leveraging 
IoT technology—to address this concern specifically in indoor environments. 
 
This project revolves around an IoT-based dust detection system designed to not only detect 
but also manage dust levels indoors. The system employs a dust detection sensor seamlessly 
integrated with a Node MCU ESP8266 microcontroller. This setup enables real-time 
monitoring of dust concentrations. When the dust levels surpass predefined thresholds, the 
system autonomously triggers the activation of an exhaust fan. The primary objective is to 
alleviate dust accumulation promptly, ensuring a healthier indoor environment for occupants. 
 
By combining advancements in sensor technology with IoT capabilities, this system offers a 
proactive approach to indoor air quality management. It acts as a preemptive measure against 
potential health hazards associated with elevated dust levels. Furthermore, the integration of 
smart functionalities facilitates swift and efficient response mechanisms, contributing to 
overall environmental well-being. 
 
In essence, this project presents a user-friendly and efficient solution to tackle indoor air 
pollution, particularly concerning particulate matter. Its implementation holds promise for 
enhancing the quality of life in urban areas by fostering cleaner and healthier indoor 
environments.
